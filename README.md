# Application-Layer-Protocol
This protocol creates a client and server socket using the Python socket library. This allows the client to communicate and request the server to perform file management functions.
- Uses Mininet to implement a network application that allows a user to perform remote file management.
- Performs file management functions including sending, copying, creating, renaming and deleting a list of files on the server to send back to the client once each job is completed.
